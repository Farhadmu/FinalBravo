# Comprehensive Project Audit & Analysis Report

## Project Overview
The platform is a high-performance, enterprise-grade IQ Test & Coaching Platform designed for defense recruitment preparation. It bridge the gap between complex pedagogical requirements (verbal, non-verbal, and word association tests) and professional, user-friendly digital delivery.

---

## Architecture & Tech Stack

### Frontend: Next.js 16 (React 19)
- **Framework**: Bleeding-edge Next.js 16 utilizing React 19 features.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for high-fidelity, responsive UI components.
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state (auth, session tracking).
- **Security**: HttpOnly Cookie-based JWT handling (prevents XSS-based token theft).
- **Dynamics**: Recharts for performance analytics and Sonner for micro-interactions.

### Backend: Django & Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Core**: Python-based Django providing a robust, scalable API.
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT implementation using `simplejwt` with cookie integration.
- **Infrastructure**: Distributed logic across 6 specialized local apps (`users`, `tests`, `questions`, `payments`, `results`, `system`).
- **File Storage**: Supabase S3-compatible storage integration for dynamic test assets.

### Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Engine**: Enterprise PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase.
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) implementation across primary tables.
- **Scale**: Indexed for performance with custom views for analytics.

## Security Posture & Hardening
The project underwent a significant "Security Transformation" during development:
1. **Authentication**: Migrated from `localStorage` to **Secure HttpOnly Cookies**, effectively neutralizing common XSS attacks.
2. **Access Control**: Implemented strict RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). Students can only access paid tests upon payment verification, while Admins manage the ecosystem.
3. **Data Protection**: 
   - Evaluation logic is strictly backend-processed to prevent "Answer Spoofing."
   - Serializers filter out `correct_answer` and `explanation` fields during active tests.
4. **Infra Hardening**: 
   - CSP (Content Security Policy) implemented to prevent unauthorized script execution.
   - API Throttling enforced to prevent brute-force attacks on login/registration.

## Features & Capabilities
- **Multi-Category IQ Tests**: specialized support for Verbal, Non-Verbal (Diagrammatic), and WAT (Timer-based).
- **Auto-Generating Question Banks**: Support for randomized "Virtual Sets" from a unified 1,400+ question repository.
- **Seamless Payment Flow**: Integrated "Pay-to-Unlock" mechanism with administrative verification.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Real-time performance tracking with detailed accuracy and time-taken metrics.
- **Developer Central**: Built-in monitoring tools for maintenance, health checks, and database inspection.

---

## Code Quality & Engineering
- **Standardization**: Use of standard DRF ViewSets/Serializers for predictable API behavior.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns between business logic (models) and API representation (serializers).
- **Automation**: Django signals used for real-time synchronization of test metadata (`total_questions`).
- **Asset Integrity**: S3-backed image management with robust fallback mechanisms.

## Improvements & "What's Next"
While the platform is production-ready, these areas offer growth potential:
1. **Real-time Proctoring**: AI-based tab-switch detection and webcam monitoring.
2. **PWA Integration**: Offline test-taking capability for students with unstable internet.
3. **Multi-Currency/Automated Gateway**: Integration with SSLCommerze or Stripe for instant enrollment.
4. **Advanced AI Explanations**: Using LLM integration to generate dynamic feedback for wrong answers.

## Transformation Narrative: From "Dummy" to "Enterprise"
The most impressive part of this project is its evolution:
- **Phase A**: Primitive dummy data with base Next.js layout.
- **Phase B**: Robust multi-app Django backend implementation.
- **Phase C**: Security Lockdown (Cookies, RLS, CSP).
- **Phase D**: Content Expansion (Seeding 1,400+ questions including complex diagrams).
- **Phase E**: Production Deployment (Render, Vercel, Supabase) with real-time health verification.

**The system is now a fully functional, secure, and professional gateway for the next generation of defense candidates.**
